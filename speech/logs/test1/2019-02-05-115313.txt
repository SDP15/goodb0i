Perfect. Today I will be guiding you around the shop. You can give me a list of items or simply browse the shop. Would you like more information about this service?
Keyword detected: yes
I am a shopping trolley that follows a route around the shop to help you pick up items. To give me a list simply attach your smartphone and send me the list... I will tell you when we have arrived at an item. In this shop, the items will always be on your right. I will then tell you what item you have arrived at, and what shelf the item is on. Would you like an example?

The Garlic Bread is on the middle shelf... Once you have selected an item, you can scan its barcode using the camera on your phone. Don't worry, I will help you with this. Once you have scanned the item, I can tell you information about the item you have picked up. If you pick up the wrong item, you can try again. Does this make sense?
